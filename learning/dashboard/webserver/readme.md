#	What is a web server?


The Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and other protocols are used by the web server, a piece of hardware and software, to accept and process requests from clients all over the world. The web server displays contents by storing them, then gives users access to the webpages via text, images, videos, and other media. It employs
Physical Storage: To ensure the security of website data, all data is kept on a physical web server. A request is created and sent to the web server to process the data when an end user types the URL of your website into their browser or searches for it using a keyword.
Finding the web server on which to host a website is the responsibility of web browsers like Firefox, Chrome, or Internet Explorer.
## Use of a web server:-
A web server is primarily used to deliver and display website content to users or clients. The following are additional applications for web servers:
• Store and safeguard website data: A web server has the capacity to store and safeguard sensitive website data from unauthorised users.
• Manage bandwidth to control network traffic: A web server can assist in removing downtime brought on by heavy web traffic. In order to control the rate of data transmission over the internet and reduce unnecessary network traffic, web hosts can configure bandwidth.
• Server-side web scripting: This feature enables users to use scripting languages like Ruby, Python, and PHP to create dynamic web pages.
• Virtual hosting: In order to run multiple applications, websites, and data, web servers can also be used as virtual servers.

#	Why do we need web servers?

The purpose of a web server is to store, process, and provide to users any requested data or webpages.
Requests for static material (such as HTML pages, files, pictures, and videos) from a website are accepted by and handled by a web server.Just HTTP requests and answers are handled by web servers.

# What are the different web servers available ?

There are mainly 5 Types of Web Servers:
•	Apache
•	Nginx
•	Microsoft IIS
•	Lighttpd
•	Jigsaw


**Apache :**

The most extensively used and well-liked web server globally is Apache. The Apache Foundation creates and maintains it as open-source software. Since Apache is renowned for its dependability, adaptability, and efficiency, it is frequently used to host websites of all sizes. With a large selection of modules and plugins available to increase its functionality, it is also extremely customisable.
Apache can be used to host dynamic material, such as websites created with server-side programming languages like PHP, in addition to delivering static content, such HTML pages and photos. Moreover, it is capable of acting as a reverse proxy server, which routes requests received from the internet to one or more backend servers.

**Nginx :**

Another well-liked open-source web server, Nginx, is renowned for both its great performance and minimal resource use. It can also be used to cache static information for quicker delivery to consumers. It is frequently used as a reverse proxy server, diverting traffic to other servers and services. High traffic websites are frequently hosted by Nginx, which is frequently used with Apache to distribute the load between the two servers.
The capacity of Nginx to effectively handle a large number of concurrent connections is one of its important characteristics. It can handle requests asynchronously and has an event-driven architecture, making it well-suited to handle heavy traffic levels.

**Microsoft IIS :**

A proprietary web server created by Microsoft for use with the Windows operating system is called IIS (Internet Information Services). With support for many different web technologies and protocols, it is a strong and feature-rich web server. Enterprise environments frequently employ IIS, which is connected with other Microsoft goods like Active Directory and Exchange.
Static web pages, dynamic web pages, and web-based apps can all be hosted on IIS, a powerful and expandable web server. It may be customised with a range of modules and extensions to add new features and capabilities. It supports a variety of programming languages, including ASP.NET, PHP, and Python.

**Lighttpd :**

A free and open-source web server called Lighttpd was created to be small, quick, and effective. Because it is built in C and has a small memory footprint, it is a viable option for hosting busy websites on servers with limited resources.
One of Lighttpd's primary characteristics is its modular architecture, which enables users to quickly alter and expand the server's capabilities. FastCGI, URL rewriting and server-side programming languages like PHP and Ruby are just a few of the features it provides. Moreover, it can be set up to operate with external authentication modules and includes built-in support for SSL/TLS.

**Jigsaw :**

The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created the web server Jigsaw as a reference implementation of the HTTP/1.1 protocol. For programmers curious about HTTP protocols and web server technology, Jigsaw is still a popular option.
Jigsaw's modular design, which enables customers to easily adapt and increase the server's capability, is one of its primary benefits. CGI, server-side programming languages like PHP and Python, and SSL/TLS encryption are just a few of the features it provides. Moreover, it includes built-in support for virtual hosting, which enables the hosting of numerous websites on a single server.
